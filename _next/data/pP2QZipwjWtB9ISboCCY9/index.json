{"pageProps":{"md":"# nox-macro\r\n\r\nAn editor for Nox android emulator macros.\r\n\r\nNox itself lets you record a series of clicks or actions, but provides no means (to my knowledge) of\r\nediting an existing macro other than complete re-recording. This tool aims to provide a friendlier\r\nmeans of adjusting timing and refining macros.\r\n\r\nAs these macros are stored in a plaintext format, anyone with a text editor and some familiarity\r\nwith the proprietary format could edit them directly. Unfortunately, all actions use absolute\r\ntimestamps, so a single edit near the start of a long macro will require cascading updates to all\r\nlines that follow. It can make for a rather tedious undertaking at best.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\non windows, Nox macro related files are stored at\r\n```\r\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\nox\\records\r\n```\r\nThe macro files have random(-ish) names (i.e. unique ids generated to avoid collision) and no\r\nextension. The exception is the `record` file, which stores metadata about all macros in `json`\r\nformat. By updating the `record` file, recognizable filenames can be given to macro files if desired.\r\n\r\n- Click 'Select File' and pick the desired macro file from the directory above.\r\n\r\n- Use 'Load' to replace any current editor contents with the file you've selected.\r\n\r\n- Use 'Import' to add the contents of the file after the action currently selected in the editor.\r\n\r\n- Click/select items in the action list to edit their values or enable deletion (using the trash can\r\nicon).\r\n\r\n- Drag items in the action list to reorder them.\r\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
